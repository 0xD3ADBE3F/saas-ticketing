# Mollie Connect for Platforms - Implementation Guide

> **Status:** 🔴 Not Started
> **Docs:** https://docs.mollie.com/docs/connect-platforms-getting-started

This document tracks the implementation of Mollie Connect for Platforms, which enables our multi-tenant ticketing SaaS to process payments on behalf of organizations (customers).

---

## Overview

Mollie Connect for Platforms allows us to:

- Onboard organizations as connected Mollie accounts
- Process payments on behalf of organizations
- Collect **Application fees** (platform fees) per transaction
- Provide organizations with their own Mollie dashboard

### Why Mollie Connect?

For our ticketing platform:

- **Organizations** are our customers (tenants)
- **Buyers** purchase tickets from organizations
- **Platform fee** is charged on used tickets only
- Each organization needs their own Mollie account for payouts

## Technical Details

### Required OAuth Scopes

```
payments.read
payments.write
profiles.read
profiles.write
organizations.read
onboarding.read
settlements.read
balances.read
```

### Environment Variables (New)

```env
# Mollie OAuth App (Connect for Platforms)
MOLLIE_CLIENT_ID=
MOLLIE_CLIENT_SECRET=
MOLLIE_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-domain.com/api/auth/mollie/callback

# Existing (keep for fallback/admin)
MOLLIE_API_KEY=
```

### Database Schema Changes

New fields needed on `Organization` model:

```prisma
model Organization {
  // ... existing fields

  // Mollie Connect
  mollieOrganizationId  String?   @unique
  mollieAccessToken     String?   // Encrypted
  mollieRefreshToken    String?   // Encrypted
  mollieTokenExpiresAt  DateTime?
  mollieOnboardingStatus String?  // pending, in_review, completed
  mollieProfileId       String?
}
```

### Key API Endpoints

| Endpoint                | Purpose                            |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `POST /oauth2/tokens`   | Exchange auth code for tokens      |
| `POST /v2/client-links` | Create onboarding link             |
| `GET /v2/onboarding/me` | Check onboarding status            |
| `GET /v2/profiles`      | List organization profiles         |
| `POST /v2/payments`     | Create payment (with access token) |
| `GET /v2/settlements`   | Get settlement data                |
| `GET /v2/balances`      | Get balance data                   |

### Application Fees (Platform Fees)

When creating a payment on behalf of an organization:

```typescript
const payment = await mollieClient.payments.create(
  {
    amount: { value: "25.00", currency: "EUR" },
    description: "Ticket for Event XYZ",
    redirectUrl: "https://...",
    webhookUrl: "https://...",

    // Application fee - goes to our platform account
    applicationFee: {
      amount: { value: "1.25", currency: "EUR" }, // 5% platform fee
      description: "Platform fee",
    },
  },
  {
    // Use organization's access token
    accessToken: organization.mollieAccessToken,
  }
);
```

> ⚠️ **Important:** Our platform fee is only charged on **used tickets**. We need to handle this differently - likely as a separate charge/settlement after scanning, not as an upfront application fee.

### Platform Fee Strategy Options

1. **Application Fee on Payment** (Mollie native)
   - Fee charged immediately when payment succeeds
   - ❌ Doesn't work for our model (fee only on scanned tickets)

2. **Post-Event Settlement** (Our model)
   - Track scanned tickets
   - Calculate platform fee after event
   - Create separate invoice/charge to organization
   - ✅ Matches our business model

3. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Small base application fee on payment
   - Additional settlement for scanned ticket fees
   - 🤔 More complex

## Notes & Decisions

### Decision Log

| Date | Decision           | Rationale                                                  |
| ---- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| TBD  | Platform fee model | Need to decide on application fee vs post-event settlement |
| TBD  | Token encryption   | Need to choose encryption method for stored tokens         |
| TBD  | Fallback handling  | What happens if org's Mollie account has issues?           |

### Open Questions

- [ ] How to handle organizations that haven't completed Mollie onboarding?
- [ ] Should we allow events to be published before Mollie is connected?
- [ ] How to handle refunds when platform fee was already collected?
- [ ] What's the reconciliation frequency for post-event fees?
