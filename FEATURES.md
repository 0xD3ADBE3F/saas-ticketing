## Recent Fixes & Updates

### 30 December 2024

#### Invoice & Billing UI Improvements

- ✅ **Fixed Billings Page** - Resolved server/client component conflict

  - Fixed issue where `window.location.href` was being used in server component context
- ✅ **Color Consistency** - Updated billing page to match dashboard theme
  - Applied dark mode-aware color classes (`dark:bg-gray-900`, `dark:text-gray-400`, etc.)
  - Updated `BillingHistory` component with proper dark mode support
  - Updated `InvoiceFilters` component with dark mode colors
  - All components now consistent with rest of dashboard styling

- ✅ **Simplified Invoice Table & Added Modal** - Improved UX for viewing invoices
  - Removed columns: Vervaldatum (due date), Bedrag (base amount), BTW (VAT amount)
  - Table now shows: Factuurnummer, Type, Datum, Totaal bedrag, Status, PDF icon
  - Created `InvoiceDetailModal` component to show full invoice details
  - Table rows are now clickable to open modal with complete information
  - Modal includes all details: dates, amounts breakdown, description, and PDF download

#### Mollie Sales Invoice API Integration (Phase 3.5)

- ✅ **Automatic Invoice Generation** - Full Mollie Sales Invoice API integration
  - Invoices created using platform's MOLLIE_API_KEY (not organization OAuth tokens)
  - `mollieInvoiceService.ts` with full API integration and error handling

#### 18.4 Billing & Payments (Mollie-managed)

> **Note:** All billing, invoicing, and payment methods are handled by Mollie. We only need to integrate with their APIs.

  - ✅ Real-time usage display on subscription page
- ⬜ Overage billing (charged at payout):
  - Calculate overage: `(ticketsSold - limit) × overageFee`
  - Deduct from payout alongside platform fee
- ⬜ Branding removal fee:

**Phase 3.5: Sales Invoice API Integration** (For Organization Subscription Invoicing) ✅

> **Goal:** Automatically generate formal invoices for organization subscription payments using Mollie's Sales Invoice API (Beta).
>
> **Status:** ✅ Implementation complete. Invoice generation integrated with subscription payment webhooks. Invoices are created using the platform's Mollie account (MOLLIE_API_KEY), not organization OAuth tokens.
>
> **See:** [docs/PHASE_3_5_COMPLETE.md](./docs/PHASE_3_5_COMPLETE.md) for full implementation details.

| Task                                             | Status |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| Full Mollie Sales Invoice API integration        | ✅     |
| VAT calculation (reverse: Net = Gross / 1.21)    | ✅     |
| Invoice number generation (YYYY-NNNN format)     | ✅     |
| Webhook integration (subscription + event)       | ✅     |
| Idempotency (molliePaymentId unique constraint)  | ✅     |
| Structured logging (mollieLogger)                | ✅     |
| Error handling with detailed logs                | ✅     |
| PDF proxy endpoint for secure downloads          | ✅     |
| Organization address placeholders (TODO: actual) | ⚠️     |

**Key Architecture Points:**

- Invoices created with **platform's MOLLIE_API_KEY** (not org OAuth)
- Invoices are FROM Entro TO organizations (for subscription fees)
- Status set to "paid" immediately after successful payment
- Organizations don't need Mollie accounts to receive subscription invoices

**Testing Completed:**

- Manual testing via subscription upgrade flow
- Invoice appears in Mollie dashboard
- PDF download works correctly
- Billing history displays invoices with all details

| Downgrade scheduled | Notice: "Downgrades to [plan] on [date]"                  |

##### Mobile Responsiveness

- ✅ Plan cards: 4 columns → 2 columns → 1 column
- ⬜ Usage meter: Horizontal bar → Circular gauge on mobile
- ⬜ Billing table: Horizontal scroll or card view on mobile

##### Error Handling

- ⬜ Payment failed: Show retry option + update payment method
- ✅ Downgrade blocked: Show which limits are exceeded
- ⬜ Network error: Retry button with cached data display

#### 18.6 Platform Admin UI

- ⬜ Organization subscription view:
  - Current plan & status
  - Usage stats (tickets this period)
  - Override plan limits (special deals)
  - Manual plan assignment
- ⬜ Subscription reports:
  - MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
  - Plan distribution (count per tier)
  - Churn rate
  - Overage revenue

#### 18.7 Event-Level Fee Overrides (Platform Admin)

- ✅ Add to Event model:
  - `platformFeeOverride` (nullable Int, basis points e.g., 200 = 2%)
  - `overageFeeOverride` (nullable Int, cents per ticket)
  - `feeOverrideReason` (String, required when override is set)
  - `feeOverrideSetBy` (SuperAdmin userId)
  - `feeOverrideSetAt` (DateTime)
- ✅ Fee resolution logic in `feeService`:

  ```
  getPlatformFee(event):
    if event.platformFeeOverride != null:
      return event.platformFeeOverride
    if org.brandingRemoved && plan != PRO_ORGANIZER:
      return 400 (4%)
    return 200 (2%)

  getOverageFee(event, plan):
    if event.overageFeeOverride != null:
      return event.overageFeeOverride
    return PLAN_OVERAGE_FEES[plan]
  ```

- ⬜ Platform Admin UI (`/platform/events/[id]/fees`):
  - View current effective fees (plan default vs override)
  - Set custom platform fee (0-10% range)
  - Set custom overage fee (€0.00 - €1.00 per ticket)
  - Required reason field (e.g., "Partnership deal", "Charity event")
  - Audit log entry on every change
- ⬜ Fee override validations:
  - Only SuperAdmins can set overrides
  - Override cannot be negative
  - Override change creates AdminAuditLog entry

#### 18.8 Enforcement Points

- ⬜ Event creation:
  - Allow event creation in DRAFT status without restrictions
  - Check `canCreateEvent()` for active event limits (only when going live)
  - Show upgrade prompt if limit reached
- ⬜ **Event publish (DRAFT → LIVE) gating:**
  - ❌ Block if Mollie onboarding not completed (`mollieOnboardingStatus !== COMPLETED`)
  - ❌ Block if no active subscription (must be on any plan, including NON_PROFIT)
  - Show clear checklist UI with remaining steps:
    - [ ] Connect payment account (Mollie)
    - [ ] Choose a subscription plan
  - Redirect to appropriate onboarding step when blocked
- ⬜ Checkout flow:
  - Check `canSellTickets()` before completing order
  - For overage-enabled plans: allow but track overage
  - For NON_PROFIT: hard block at 500 tickets
- ⬜ Payout calculation:
  - Use `getPlatformFee(event)` for fee calculation (respects overrides)
  - Use `getOverageFee(event, plan)` for overage (respects overrides)
  - Include branding removal fee if applicable

#### 18.9 Non-Profit Verification (Required for Free Plan)

- ⬜ KVK (Chamber of Commerce) verification during NON_PROFIT plan signup:
  - User enters KVK number during plan selection
  - **KVK API integration (TBD):** Will validate organization is registered as non-profit
  - Until API is ready: manual verification workflow
- ⬜ Verification status on Organization:
  - `nonProfitStatus`: `PENDING | VERIFIED | REJECTED | NOT_APPLICABLE`
  - `kvkNumber` (String, required for NON_PROFIT plan)
  - `kvkVerifiedAt` (DateTime)
  - `kvkRejectionReason` (String, nullable)
- ⬜ Verification workflow:
  - NON_PROFIT plan selection → enter KVK number → submit for verification
  - Until verified: can create DRAFT events but cannot publish
  - On verification: full NON_PROFIT plan access
  - On rejection: must upgrade to paid plan or appeal
- ⬜ Platform Admin verification UI:
  - Queue of pending verifications
  - Manual approve/reject with reason
  - View KVK details (when API available)
- ⬜ Auto-downgrade if verification rejected:
  - Notify user via email
  - Block event publishing until resolved
  - Offer upgrade to paid plan as alternative

**DoD (Slice 18)**

- ✅ Unit tests: overage calculation accuracy
- ✅ Unit tests: upgrade/downgrade rules
- ✅ Unit tests: event-level fee override resolution
- ✅ Unit tests: event publish gating (Mollie + subscription required)

- ✅ Integration test: Usage tracking updates correctly (manual testing completed)
- ⬜ Integration test: KVK API verification (when available)
- ✅ E2E: organizer can upgrade from NON_PROFIT to ORGANIZER (manual testing completed)
- ⬜ E2E: overage fees appear in payout calculation
- ⬜ E2E: platform admin can set fee override on event
- ⬜ E2E: user cannot publish event without Mollie onboarding
- ⬜ E2E: user cannot publish event without active subscription
- ⬜ E2E: NON_PROFIT user cannot publish without KVK verification
- ✅ Cannot downgrade if current usage exceeds new plan limits
- ✅ Usage stats update in real-time after ticket sales
- ⬜ Fee override changes create audit log entries

**Known Issues Resolved:**

- ✅ Fixed: "The payment method selected does not accept recurring payments" error
  - Solution: Removed explicit method parameter, let Mollie auto-select recurring-capable methods
- ✅ Fixed: Redirect happens before webhook completes processing
  - Solution: Added SubscriptionPaymentPoller component polling dedicated `/api/subscription/status` endpoint
  - Architecture: Replaced router.refresh() (full page re-render) with lightweight fetch() to API endpoint
  - Improved UX: Clear loading indicator with "Abonnement wordt ingesteld..." message and progress counter
- ✅ Fixed: Mandate validation timeout (6s insufficient for Mollie's 10-15s creation time)
  - Solution: Increased retry logic from 3×2s to 6×3s (18 seconds total)
- ✅ Fixed: Subscription not visible in Mollie dashboard (test mode confusion)
  - Solution: Documented test/live mode toggle requirement
- ✅ Fixed: Risk of double-charging when subscription starts immediately
  - Solution: Added startDate parameter (subscription starts next month)
- ✅ Fixed: "Verbruik deze maand" shows 0 tickets
  - Solution: Added recordTicketSale() calls to both payment handlers
  - Solution: Fixed usage calculation to handle event-based vs monthly plans separately
- ✅ Fixed: Usage not updating for ORGANIZER plan
  - Solution: Added recordTicketSale() to molliePaymentService.ts (real payments)
- ✅ Fixed: Excessive console.log output
  - Solution: Migrated to structured logging with mollieLogger
- ✅ Fixed: Query logs cluttering development console
  - Solution: Disabled Prisma query logging
